# ProjectOrganizeConcert

# purpose od the project :

The project handles a pool of musicians for performances. Given a text file, each line in the file contains the name of a player consisting of several words.

Then the instruments on which the musician plays will appear when after each instrument Playing The price charged by the musician for a performance will be displayed if he plays this instrument.

The words that make up the musician's name, the names of the instruments and the prices, are separated by spaces and special notes.
In addition, there is a text file containing a collection of musical instruments, with one instrument listed in each line.
It is guaranteed that every instrument mentioned in the musicians file does appear in the instrument file.

The program will receive performances from the user, where the performance has a name, date, musical instruments needed for the performance and how many of each musical instrument has need.

Also, a performance will give importance to a musical instrument (1/0), when if the instrument is "important" then they will prefer expensive musicians for it, and otherwise - they will prefer cheap musicians.


The purpose of the program is to organize performances by placing musicians from the repository for performances.
Assuming that the performances take place on different dates, and that the musicians are always available.
